# Automaton Designer
C# Finite State Automaton Designer made using Unity as a front-end tool, quickly draw and simulate how a FSA behaves.

This was made as a quick study project just to improve my skills using Unity's UI tools while at the same time learning about FSAs, I'm fully aware of it's issues and bugs and will get around to fixing them sometime in the future, but when tools such as JFLAP exists, it renders projects such as this one pretty pointless, but still fun and educational to make. 

Feel free to give it a look, just know that you need to have Unity Engine installed because it has never been build so it can only be ran in the engine. 

Enjoy!
